# AVR LLVM Integrated Tester

This directory contains the sources of `libavrlit`, a test suite library to
test code generated by our backend on the target. It uses the
[LUFA USB library](http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php)
([GitHub](https://github.com/abcminiuser/lufa)) and its makefiles. This library
and the test executbale are compiled using avr-gcc.

The test executables built with this framework connect to the host as a USB CDC
device. They wait for the terminal to become ready before executing the tests. Results
are printed in a format similar to `llvm-lit`.
